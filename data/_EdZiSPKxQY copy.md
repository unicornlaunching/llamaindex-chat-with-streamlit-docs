hi hi hello how are we hello how are we what do you think is it a little better no it sounds like you're bored like hello that's funny oh I think I think I drop I draw I dropped my jaw a little bit for that but I'll keep I'll keep trying yeah because we know how these Australians are like slack jawed yokels but maybe that's a good voice in general maybe I don't know I work I'll work on it um um I won't work on it all right so check this out um does this work okay good okay so and this is mostly Casey's fault so Casey showed me how to bulk upload things to spatial cool so uh you know Carnage from Spider-Man you know Venom Carnage Cletus Cassidy yes okay so what I did is I used the dream Studio to create a bunch of ethernet cabley maximum carnages whoa right and uh so I generated maybe I don't know 30 to 50 images once I got the prompt you could just keep repeating it right so I made a bunch of images and then I bulk uploaded it to um spatial so this tutorial I'm uploading now is like a minute and six seconds to go from uh the dream Studio to a full spatial art gallery amazing that must look so full uh I like Carnage I like the idea of Carnage you know oh absolutely yeah absolutely Casey this is all your father [Music] it's your fault that I'm on Wambo so you're welcome so lucky yesterday okay Studio hey Mason I'm shaking there folks uh you know we're just um questioning our Humanity by creating AI art it could be worse things in the world womboing it up are you no look we're a little I'm a little more classy than Wombo that's Casey I think Casey works for Wombo yeah he's a plant he called me up the other day and he's like Wombo do Wombo you can do anything on Wombo it's like this it's like the slowest play ever where he's like he doesn't even help people with their houses or loans just this two-year con it's pretty neat app though pretty cool like I ran a couple nfts through it and it came up with just [ __ ] that didn't even look like an nft but it was like it looks like something else like very steam Punky that was the one I picked right and it was just amazing like it was like wow I know it's just computer generated [ __ ] random graphics and [ __ ] but hey pretty cool pretty cool I like it so what I did um I was joking around with a friend and I have this I'm not sure if it's a sickness at this point but I like turning images into ethernet cable versions of the image what sorry I'm sorry I've got a message for Mason from Hunter go ahead Hunter um my dad's gonna go play now all right see you later Hunter bye have fun Hunter Hunter tell Daddy rug rug rug rug yeah so I saw this thing where someone turned Pepe the Frog into it was almost like they redrew it but with and with a collection of ethernet cables and I was like yeah color did they color the cables yeah so they were like green bright green cable oh nice oh my God so I just had this addiction um I'm I'm doing the e-learning for a network cabling course you know doing fiber optic and coaxial copper and so I was like I want to create more things in uh ethernet cables and then I went from Ethernet cable so like recreate Akuma from Street Fighter with pairs of pants trying to mix the mediums you know I've seen some people do that with clothing and stuff where it creates like the shadows and the light and [ __ ] like that like people are creative man like there was one I thought it was amazing he he uses like tempered uh you know the coated glass or something and he lays it on like floor concrete whatever but he uses specific like chip chipping Hammers and he smashes the glass properly and creates portraits out of the glass [ __ ] it it's really cool right like add a little uh colored dye to the cracks and [ __ ] like that and proper lighting amazing absolutely amazing [ __ ] you just gave me the idea to use mirrors yeah oh wow yep um yeah he paid a bit more it wasn't just regular glass because it has to stick together like a front car windshield kind of [ __ ] you know shatter proof I guess but it still cracks and then he can get it up and he's got it up on the wall and pretty cool absolutely cool one that I'd actually get a kick out of trying to oh man the Maximum Carnage with the mirrors is interesting let's see if this is up yet that would be cool okay let's see how it looks oh yeah it's it's creating kind of like my Carnage into like shards of glass uh all right so this is almost uh I'm gonna put to the top You're Gonna Go have you ever used spatial that spatial dot IO Oh I thought you said have you ever had a facial I was like not that kind of space yet well not since college but thanks hey I've had a pedicure no I don't not a big app usually I got a few things on my computer [ __ ] just stick to the my drawing tablet mostly all right so check this out I just put it to the top foreign one's in Hamilton if you're looking at the factor only looking at the fat girls [Laughter] I like it when they feel like a cushion it's like a I want a sofa that's cool a great good video thanks man now can you do that like have them in order on in your files and then upload it and they'll be in some sort of order or no it's a good question I will have to rename the files and and try but what I'll do is um I'll create a new space uh create one through ten and then try it again it's a good question I just wonder might make my life easier but that's amazing that is so cool it's getting faster it's like maybe we'll have that Holo deck you know maybe we'll get there man I live in Nova Scotia we got hammered on that hurricane dude you're in Nova Scotia Nova schools wow how is it out there not bad where I'm at I'm about a kilometer away from which is about 0.6 of a mile away from the water but uh yeah the coastal towns took up eating took a beating I guess they found the body of some old lady who got swept out floating in the bay so yeah not the greatest time in the good old Nova Scotia Atlanta Canada yeah the title surges were well over like 30 feet whoa that's pretty bad yeah is that the worst that's not the worst hurricane that they wrote it was weird to listen to the science and I just kind of learned this a little bit so I'll be vague about it at the same time so we've had stronger category hurricanes hit the coast but this one was a lower category but it had such a high millibar on the barometer scale that it made it really really [ __ ] nasty for some reason however that works in the Science World that was the reason why this one apparently I guess was the worst one we've ever been hit with it was uh yeah it was pretty bad but we got power back on within a day and [ __ ] like that so I had to make coffee on a camp stove but in the morning that was about it I plugged my battery pack into the into the Wi-Fi router and we had we got our internet back so those lines didn't go down so that was nice oh that's good yeah but uh yeah there's some places still out of power and [ __ ] with it a lot of trees felt a lot of trees fell oh I never like hearing that yeah how long you been out there uh uh two years this year yeah it came out for just some contract work and got kind of stuck here and I'm enjoying it for a bit helping a friend out with her house and whatnot so she's doing a bunch of Renovations so me what not I can't even go live in my house because I leased it out so yeah on the road on the road just being a kid again I guess have you noticed uh that I mean you've only been there for two years so have you noticed anything about the weather changing out there like has it gotten worse do you worry it sucks for your grandkids right yeah has it changed a lot I think pollution is bad I don't think they're taking it seriously enough the Glaciers are melting like I was watching a video just the other day and it was just historical thing there's a place called athabascan Columbia ice Fields it's athabascular Glacier up in the Rockies and it's called Columbia ice Fields athavashkin Glacier and it's just beautiful and I do remember going there several times when I was a kid driving through from British Columbia to Alberta we stopped there all the time and the glacier was right there like pretty close like you just the road Glacier it wasn't a hike to it now when you stop there you have must be mile a mile mile and a half up the side of the hill to get up to the glacier not much left but they said all the glaciers in Canada should be gone by 2030 to 2050. hard to believe yep do you think there's anything we can do to stop it I we haven't helped the situation I think but this is one of those breaths of the earth we haven't helped it we've sped it up but the Earth has this way of going through this ice age and the change and you know without a meteorite hitting it's been pretty consistent that this [ __ ] happens quite a lot right just that what do they say this is probably the Earth's ninth Ice Age that we can measure kind of thing so we're just caught at the tail of it because if we lived you know 10 15 000 years ago the world was covered in a lot of ice so we'd be going holy [ __ ] why is it so [ __ ] cold around here look at all this ice what can we do about it yeah I mean I've read you know what's happening now may be consistent with with the end of the interglacial that we're currently in the beginning of the end of it but it should be a long I would think wait a minute is that what they mean by the age of Aquarius [Laughter] yeah really it was right there in the name yes for sure well now that we can block boys maybe we can figure out some crazy way I knew that we should have blamed the astrologists this whole time I think you're right for such a such a thing but we've got bigger things to worry about so right now they've tested they're testing a did you see that the spacecraft they're launching from Earth and it's going to collide with a small Moon that is circling an asteroid and they're going to try to hit that with a spaceship they're going to destabilize the orbit of the moon hopefully trying to change the directory direction of a meteorite flying through space this is what they're going to do like now not not 10 years we're going to do it like this week or something so you're saying we need an artist they're not it's not coming at us like this is a test what is it called I don't know what it was called but uh deGrasse Tyson guy uh what's his name Neil yeah yeah um he was talking about and he's laughing about the concept of it right you know throwing a rock at a at the ocean and see how many waves you can make kind of thing but he actually said unfortunately we should have been doing this [ __ ] since the 60s and 70s is because if it does happen at least we could have said well we tried that that didn't work so he's excited to see the results but he's not optimistic about the results he's like yeah you think like but they're they're doing it smart people are in NASA right now trying to throw a spacecraft at a moon circling an asteroid to see if they can change its direction that's NASA crashes spacecraft into an asteroid in the first ever planetary defense test did they do that today I saw a bunch of nerds yeah looking at the screens I didn't know if you got it done or not they were they seemed happy meals but it's hard to tell nerds directly to the um you know maybe it's Stanley Kubrick theater [Laughter] that's that's what uh that's what this was like yeah what was that old movie about the asteroids aliens or asteroids say they're good are they what what movie um oh sorry it was a movie about I think asteroids hitting the Earth [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and then there was a deep impact yes Tia Leone pretty pretty lady what's it called kind of depressing in the end of that Deep Impact maybe for the people that didn't make it but that's a good movie it was let's see here you're still looking for a name of a movie that has asteroids in it uh uh Armageddon I said that hold on okay no this was like a kind of like a it was shot like it following a news show oh yeah and they're like because this one is an app store it's about to hit Earth all right huh um not Billy Bob no hold on meteor and no not at the comet no without War yeah you know that movie without warning no oh I'm gonna put it to the top it's cool because it's from like a like it it's shot like a news show um asteroid yes is it 1994 really yes okay I'm gonna put if you want to just like you know scroll to the end of the movie the last five minutes is you know I guess like most movies right okay you know watch the first five minutes the middle five minutes last five minutes after the cop without warning great movie so Mason how do you know Casey oh geez just a web free stuff about a year ago I guess we've been hanging out we were doing some crypto stuff [ __ ] talking together and then I kind of moved off in the nfts and yeah we're just kind of hanging out since good guy did some artwork for his kids yeah I keep telling them to frame them uh did you um have any money on Voyager no no nice watching all our friends [ __ ] flail around yeah you saw that right oh geez like Casey and I were just like like they were going crazy about it got to do it gotta do it and then occasionally we're probably talking about it maybe about a month ago just a disaster that our buddies went through with that like even even so far as before the Voyager blew up in their face these guys went out and took a [ __ ] fake link off of telegram and bought their first 26 000 with it cheers they've had they had to go back and start all over again and find some more money so after they threw 26 grand out the [ __ ] window on a fake link they had to jump back in with more money and it just unfortunately hanging out with those boys and trying to listen to them they're they're smart they're intelligent but they're playing the lottery they just yeah yeah he's a digital lottery tickets yeah yeah it happened to a lot of them but you know I'm just a silent investor kind of thing I don't try to push my opinion about Investments on everybody but hey man if it looks like [ __ ] smells like [ __ ] and it tastes like [ __ ] guess what I think it's just polish yeah and it just felt that stop stop with the trying to flood like another buddy of mine here he's in uh these chameleons he was in our Discord group and he's like hey guys you should have a look at this chameleon and it's these little teddy bear things they're cute or whatever nfts and he's like it's a really good entry point 0.43 this is just a couple weeks ago 0.43 and then it went down to like 0.35 and he's like oh that's such a good entry point you guys got to get in on this I just look tonight miss point one like ah I know it's just kind of ramping across the whole nft there's nothing really really spiking but yeah I just can't get on board with these people who go around these web series spaces trying to shill projects one they're not invested in or two they or losing their shirt and they're trying to drum business up right I'd rather you come to me and say hey Mason I know it's a little late for this project but you know like I bought at .07 and right now it's 1.3 ethereum you know you might want to think about it sorry I didn't tell you a month ago that one I'll look at right not the one that went from point you know four three down to point zero seven and go you know maybe if you jumped in it'll help out no it won't dude yeah I'm not moving this Market [Laughter] yeah you got a lot of money why don't you just buy a buck no that doesn't are you [ __ ] [ __ ] me how do you think I got a lot of money by avoiding [ __ ] like this [Laughter] what's I mean I don't know like I'm 39 and I was and uh you know I was I had my financial licenses uh in the there's an eight-ish crash right and so um I understand that for a lot of people this is their first rodeo so it's like you ever see that um portrait of Icarus and Daedalus yep yeah man I hope people learn from this but you know they won't no because for a lot of people payday is Lottery day that's you know they do the same thing with lottery tickets they go to the same thing with Casino a lot of them being the same sort of thing yeah it does kind of work that way but what's the dumbest thing you invested in Mason um nothing I've tried to like not everything's been a success but it doesn't make it a dumb investment all right I'll rephrase what is the an investment you made that you have since we thought [Music] um some nfts but I don't even remember the names of them because I you know if I invest in 10 products and one or two of them take off I forget what the other eight are I don't give a [ __ ] I really don't right um when you invest sometimes you know 30 to 85 ethereum at a time right right you're more worried about what's going to go up not down um I don't know what's the worst one Shinobi in you oh yeah I think I've heard of that yeah that was probably the worst one um not that it's lost any money for me it just has stopped and I don't think there's any traction so no I did well with early Bitcoin and early ethereum years ago like 2009 2010s yet oh amazing yeah like my average on bitcoin I think is 13 or 1400 each oh nice yeah some drunk guy in his garage with a computer it's like you gotta buy some of this and I was like what's that it's gonna be all over the place dude I bought a bunch you just have thousands of it but over time you just spend it invest right yeah not like the guy who spent 10 000 Bitcoin on a pizza I know I can't even imagine you know like like holy moly but at the time though well there was nothing wrong with that like do you know what I mean like yeah it sucks now but at the time his Bitcoin was worth 25 bucks it was delicious pizza yeah I bet you it was [ __ ] that would that would hurt all those things but I could look at ethereum one day and you're down five percent let's say that's two hundred thousand dollars you're down that in a day and you're going well how come I didn't sell because you don't know if it's ever going to go back up if you play that flip game you better be really [ __ ] good at it really [ __ ] good at it so to me I've just done well of just buying and forgetting don't get caught up in the game and the emotions and all this other [ __ ] look for the investment investment right sometimes it costs you more too to grab on like they talk about don't fomo into a product I don't know I've got more traction from the fomo than I have from buying the Hope on something that is just sitting at floor level yeah that's true by above the floor too like if you're buying nft buy above the floor like you could buy the floor for let's just say uh on chain monkeys the karmas they're nice they're cool I got hope in the whole long chain monkey gang um the karmas are 0.1619 I can't remember one nine I think tonight but uh don't buy them off the floor you know go get something with value Rarity uh the traits that people are sought after it's not just so much about the price of the nft as much as utility and what people are going to look for in the future so yeah I like the karmas I like the unchain monkey guys good game I think they got the [ __ ] together is it gonna Moon [ __ ] I don't know it'd be nice because I bought some at least it fails I'll just move on like look in June June May and June though like at the end of those months I bought a whole bunch of [ __ ] spent like I got a wallet manager she spent a whole bunch of money one day but it was nine products and three of them took off that month right and it was a hell of a good good month but that doesn't happen all the time all right and that was the month of moon Birds Goblin Town and other Deeds all right got lucky got super lucky does that happen all the time no because before that I spent eight months struggling right oh yeah yeah it's difficult I I'm not a traitor or flipper of nfts myself although I used to flip books from eBay to Amazon kind of the same principle I'm looking at Amazon rankings going up and down and decide you know it's always the same thing yep yep now I flip down after these people like well how many how many do you own well one day I can own 15 and then tomorrow alone two right but I'd love to flip you know like I like the feel of getting what you think is the maximum value out of something that you bought for super low yep yeah like I used to have ten four day clubs I have two left and those the other eight I you know I didn't sell them for 100 ethereum each they went for various amounts of prices that if I hold on I'd be way happier but I can't go you can't go through life looking at that I got I got money out of them and I was happy at the time so it's like Mike fedenzia you know about that product no just it's just artwork fedenzia uh look on open sea or something for 100 ethereum and I got in like floor floor floor that was like last June right good flip good flat foot costs money but if you if you uh Play Big You're Gonna Lose big two sometimes so I don't like doing that no no there is a risk it is like gambling though I'm waiting patiently with my Bitcoin yeah I have hope for Bitcoins too uh Always by ethereum doesn't doesn't matter the price doesn't matter doesn't matter if you're looking for that twenty thousand dollar ethereum in five or ten years from now well then it doesn't matter what the [ __ ] price is today 1700 1200 don't [ __ ] matter buy 50 bucks worth if you're gonna buy it and leave it don't touch it it's great investment I think and nothing blew up during the merge right nothing really went down during the merge people were going okay well 1200 bucks a day yeah well it was 900 [ __ ] a month ago I said what are you talking about like didn't you buy any at 900 you dumbass like what are you bitching about what theory on Maxis I did not know there was such a thing so aside from hanging out and uh flipping uh nfts what do you do Mason helicopters helicopters Wild yeah I have a helicopter business in Canada we rent lease on probably 18 birds and I got three out here that's what my contracts are flying them around here in PEI and Newfoundland and then a bunch doing firefighting and whatnot in BC waiting for a good ski season to come up that's my favorite part is hella skiing a bunch of kids to the top of mountains and kicking them out this guy no they don't fall out of the sky they can paint like they float they float if your engine stops okay if your engine stops and you have forward momentum and your blades are still attached that thing will float to the ground like a plane not as well as a plane but we do it every year we have to practice it it's called auto rotation look it up on YouTube good videos so you are flying along and you have to have an instructor who has to rate you on your aircraft every year Pilon proficiency check and at some point during that flight he'll just turn the engine off and the aircraft will jolt because you're not hovering at 3 000 feet you're always flying forward so the front rotor and the rear rotor are geared together so even if the engine stops those things will still be in sync and still turn With the Wind with the Ford momentum so you get a 60 mile an hour forward wind the blades are still turning and you got a couple minutes before you're going to go sliding into the ground oh okay we'll slide right into the runway hopefully yeah but sounds like it could yeah we don't like doing it all the time it's hard on the gear but we'll still we'll still practice it every year and we'll come to a 10 foot hover right he'll turn the engine on at about 60 feet and you'll come to a hover so yeah them falling out of the sky no most times it's a bad piloting bad wind very rarely does a malfunction take out an aircraft hydraulics leaving an aircraft that's just really hard to fly like on those big big big big big big helicopters the hydraulic skills you can't hold that stick yeah you'll crash but do they fall out of this guide no well that's good news unless you hit something with the tail they hit something with the tail but you know you're going to hit something with the tail if you're flying forward right but if you're coming down in the trees or power lines and you hit something with the tail yeah you're pretty [ __ ] it doesn't sound like fun oh it is the greatest thing I ever had to do is learn how to fly have you gotten into any hairy situation or yeah a few times but ice ice is a Bad Thing uh I was gonna say weather seems to be like a common thing among disasters a lot because you're not flying above the weather ever right right it hits you don't have much Choice you're not doing three 400 miles an hour to get out of the way you know you're doing 140 maybe a mile an hour the most that's it all right so weather's a big one bird strikes suck right yes all of it all of it though comes down to piloting ability so if you get caught in weather did you do your due diligence and check the weather before you left did you make the right decision right as Pilots generally we don't try to push it it is dangerous if you're a [ __ ] pilot you know there's there's old pilots and there's bold Pilots but there's no old bold Pilots uh-huh that's true yeah I wasn't paying attention to this hurricane I'm lucky I'm I'm lucky it's hitting Tampa it's the first time ever where I just kind of just did not pay attention to something like that I've never been usually one of those weather fan people that watch the Weather Channel fairly regularly you know but I don't know I just overlooked it so you know luckily it didn't really affect me obviously but you know it's coming to the other side yeah another hurricane Ian coming now ugh and Florida homes are not built as well as Canadian homes you guys got a lot of trailer parks and [ __ ] down there and you guys don't have to build homes that worry about snow load or ice load and [ __ ] like that like your houses are made out of freaking peanut brittle man well I hope not because I'm living under peanut brittle yeah they'll all float if you get flooded I can't swim no I can swim Gators all get you that well that's what I'm worried about I'm thinking that I'm thinking of the Gators and lizards will be like climbing on top of me to like escape the water yeah I saw a 400 pound Gator get captured in the streets of Texas the other day it was like yeah you got loose big 400 pound Barker right wow yeah they have those in Texas yeah they get sponsored I had no idea God you guys get a big enough wave you're gonna get washed out from Texas to Florida all the way well let's hope that doesn't happen oh that will happen absolutely melting we were just talking about this right look at New Orleans man they've been blocking the water for that many you know generations and they still can't do it like it's not going to get any better the water is rising period coastal cities New York Seattle San Francisco to Lisbon Italy Rome all these coastal cities they're just gonna be so [ __ ] when the water is all not in ice form anymore well we'll have to turn like the asteroid shooter to you know the water and redirect the water somehow yeah yeah did you see Blade Runner 2049 it was a while ago I think I vaguely remember seeing it but he's flying through the city and there's just that giant wall holding the water back from Los Angeles oh oh yeah yeah that got me thinking of escape from La back in the 80s yeah good old Kurt Russell snake plisskin yeah yeah I miss movies like that yeah that was a good one we don't have enough of them anymore no not enough Kurt Russell's in the world that's true that's true but it kind of makes me think that you know maybe maybe some of the men out there aren't really manly because they're watching like crap like like you know there's so many people you can't I know you're a woman please don't take offense to it but you can't make a woman need a movie these days you can't make a movie these days with a strong sexist male lead that looks at the woman goes yeah wow she's a nice piece of ass that's just off the table so those Kurt Russells of just being man man and the movie about man yeah they just don't fly anymore I know and that that's that person on a personal level is very depressing because you know it's like I don't mind being called a nice piece of ass I'm okay with that yeah yeah so you know but these days most men well first of all I have you know severe resting [ __ ] face so unless I'm it's not good I mean I I and and I am out of practice making sure my face stays animated so that people aren't afraid of me uh so I have to work on that a little more I I think but you know when those manly men about that doesn't matter you know then I just look crabby but right now I look like you know some dominatrix because all the manly men are no longer around we're in Canada by the way they're just we're in Canada oh the manly man oh you got you guys are like an Ice Road Truckers and stuff yeah yeah yeah I like that it's not real I get it but it's still cool Kurt Russell's best movie big trouble little China oh definitely definitely remember that what yeah I like the campy action type Goofy movies they're fun yeah good old Golden Child oh no yeah you know there's a band called rat that did a song for Golden Child and I played it like all the time working out uh during that era and then into the 90s it's a lot of fun well I'm going to jump out though I'm gonna go make a coffee I had a nap earlier now I need to stay awake for a while so big coffee I think I've got a meeting here in a bit you folks have a wonderful day thanks for the Chit Chat let me talk about stupid things always enjoy that see you later see you later a little bit about Kurt Russell middle of thank you oh man Mason's a character isn't he I love Mason he's fun and why me God endless suffering what a great teacher why do I love things like this oh man it's my favorite yeah it's like it's awesome and you know the um you've read the comic about cats wanting you know plotting your murder right read that it's one of my favorite all-time things I don't know why it's like let me die now you know I'll tear something else off you for and you've read the sorrow horoscopes right those things crack me up every time it's like just when it's like you know Leah just when you think your life cannot get worse boy were you wrong it can get worse and indeed it will you know type of you know thing it's the uh the spirit of uh living in a van down by the river yes but I guess it's the contrast that's so amusing but yes that that that t-shirt says it all endless suffering yes I put the end of that movie at the top yeah check it out you'll love it because I imagine like if it went sideways this is what the newscast would be like oh let me know I don't think I've heard anything as dark as talking with the YMCA director on his lunch break in the middle of a ghetto dude that was some dark [ __ ] it was probably one of the darkest conversations I've ever had so we did maximum couplearnage what should I do I would love to do a Venom one a Venom one would be cool you know not for nothing I see some of the actual art that you make and it's pretty [ __ ] good would you stop making everything goddamn cables you don't like the cables that's cool it's funny ah it makes some real [ __ ] I like what like what should I use now um are these bottles and pants for God damn it the pants was my favorite okay I want you to turn the microphone into the Incredible Hulk the microphone yeah take a picture of your microphone turn it off yeah that yeah wow sorry the whole time it's like is there an audio Distortion coming through my mic is that what you mean no the movie I uh without warning yeah without warning scary movie I mean it's so beautiful it's still like yeah just like if you're watching just any news program it's very dank for sure they did it all live um but it had nothing to do with that it was like for some reason that reminded me of uh it was like a one of those uh nuclear bomb like they accidentally we accidentally bombed them and they're trying to bring like a fighter plane down that has the nuclear weapon to return like because they made a deal and they weren't able to stop it I forget the name of it came from a classic book to all right never mind I'll figure it out it reminded me of that I think Harvey Keitel was in that one all right are you talking about uh throughout October no no this was like a Sci-Fi type of thing oh my God Sandra have you seen the flooding yet like is it around you um when I when I came in I was like walking through like four inches of water but I mean it stopped I don't want to say it stopped it's like drizzling where I am and right now yeah this is the bands so you're gonna get bands of storms so you get the outer bands and until the eye gets close uh-oh so I'm gonna be swimming at some point okay no no well we had a baby yeah you guys are in the tropical season no it's like one after another after another well as long as uh I'm okay with that I mean you know that there's there's going to be some sort of risk regardless of where you are um but it's not fun but at least Florida is not cold but we'll see maybe maybe it won't be I mean we're at the end of the season now I mean we're getting towards the end I think close yeah closer so we didn't do so bad but I hear this one's gonna whack Tampa one of them will anyway I think oh man uh so we'll see yeah I like that without warning I'm gonna watch the whole thing the the maybe I missed it but the excerpt I saw um is this the wait Dart mission one on here what's this uh okay so you know I saw I saw the end of the broadcast but I think it's the whole movie but I I went I watched like the last form four or five minutes of it it's gorgeous right yeah so cool I have to I have to retrain myself not to say yeah all the time um I'm going to be talking to Big Boss Man later on I have to give him a call um but oh yeah I have like garbage mouth you know do you know what I mean it's it's all the slang and the gar it's not very articulate and I've been noticing it more and more and I'm thinking uh I have to get back to like lawyer Voice using complete sentences with yes and no and pronunciation that would be great you know if you can put it on and off like a pair of pants you know what I mean right at least you won't have to do it for long you can get in and out of character yes true yes that's that's for sure I need it like I said I you know I I do that oh really yeah like I went into a space remember how there was that opportunity be a community manager right so now that those folks are taking their their stuff forward right and they hired someone else which is fine right um but I stayed in touch with the with the guy I interviewed with and so I noticed that they were having a space talking to one of the co-founders and I'm gonna tell you right now like I rehearsed what I was gonna say four or five times before I said it foreign that's good that's good just like hello how are you just had a quick question for you um is what is your plan to reinstate x y z and ABC technology as you originally intended it like like I rehearsed on like four or five times and then you know I put on the microphone you know turned up the microphone gain whispered into the mic you know what I mean like yes no guess what you don't want to I run the risk of sounding like a hillbilly you know any I should be polished so I'll have to do more of that but I think I think you can start polished and then start introducing some grit as they get to know you right like I find like it's easier to start with a very simple a very short super concise question or point and then if they want to engage with me further then they can engage with me well when people I'll give you an example when people ask me about Bitcoin I have like a lot of thoughts about it at the same time I should just break it down you know what I you know want to say but because I I immediately start thinking about sustainable development and uh basic income and all these like other type of issues that I think that Bitcoin could directly or indirectly help and but people are basically like yeah yeah yeah but what what is it it's like well it's a decentralized you know but I have so many thoughts at one time I just get word salad going on a little bit yeah so I need to crystallize my thoughts on these things better than I have in the past otherwise I'm gonna get blown up I find um the way I cheat is by speaking slower and when I speak slower it gives myself the time to think what I'm going to say next just like I'm doing right now that is something I've been practicing for the last four years probably it takes away it takes away saying like um uh the like so it's more the pause and the breath kind of like what he was teaching us that's why I'm I'm really liking the class because it's uh it's uh reminded me of some techniques and ways of things that I've learned before you know you know home after I breathing now I'm constantly breathing slowly so much more since the class started if I change anything and then I'm going to try to consciously be aware of what my breath is doing like where you're grabbing it from and how you're inhaling it and how you're how I'm inhaling yeah you know it is my belly expanding you know how sometimes you breathe in and your belly like pulls in and it's like supposed to do the opposite so I was like no no especially before I speak like because I'm watching the class go on right and I noticed that every time they talk it's about um if you're not breathing you're not living and I notice and Ali's like giving me this feedback too that she says that when I find just like I feel like I'm getting into it now which is when I finally start speaking I'll end up finding the Rhythm eventually and so if I'm going to approach a text you know just keep saying it over and over and over again until you're breathing and calm because sometimes when you're trying to get a script perfect it's like Perfection is the enemy because you're so wrapped up and trying to [ __ ] get this thing as perfect as perfect as ever perfected mm-hmm and so it's like you can't do and think I don't think you can do and think at the same time it's kind of like the same problem with golf right yeah it's like you know but potting is very hard right why because it's like even though you're closer it requires a it's like it's not almost like being a sniper with your voice um I just yell at the you know are you too good for your home go home that's what I do uh reminds me of a lot of pitches it's like it's like the Bob Barker scene oh yeah you know because he's Mr Price is Right he's such a nice guy and then he's like you know calling people a [ __ ] like what crazy yeah that's That's a classic movie in my opinion but sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you're saying sorry I take a wrecking ball the conversations which I I know is rude but I I just I couldn't it's like happy Madison's is an iconic off movie but I have to I definitely have to clean up like that like
